# Frontend-mentor-practice
Recreating projects found on Frontend Mentor 

For this project I will be attempting to recreate some single webpage projects found on Frontendmentor.io. I will also be making sure to time myself while doing them to more accurately measure project completion times. I will attempt the "newbie" challenges first, and then move on to higher difficulty challenges once I feel comfortable with basic HTML and CSS. This project will also help to familiarize myself with git workflow.
